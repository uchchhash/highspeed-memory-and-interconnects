# üöÄ HBM3 Pseudo Channel Operation Breakdown

This document explains the inner workings of **HBM3 pseudo channels** using the waveform diagram from the JEDEC specification (Figure 2). It breaks down timing, commands, and signal activity across the pseudo-channels PC0 and PC1.

---

## üß† What is a Pseudo Channel (PC)?

Each HBM3 **channel** is split into **two pseudo channels** for independent access:
- **PC0** ‚Üí DQ[31:0]
- **PC1** ‚Üí DQ[63:32]

This enhances parallelism and increases bandwidth utilization.

## üîÑ Pseudo Channel Timeline Explained

### 1. ‚è± Clocking

- **CK_t / CK_c**: Differential clocks for timing reference
- HBM3 uses DDR (Double Data Rate): transfers on both rising and falling edges

---

### 2. üß© ACTIVATE Commands

#### ACTIVATE PC0
- Brings an entire row into the row buffer from memory cells.
- Delay required before issuing READ: **tRCD (Row to Column Delay)**.

#### ACTIVATE PC1
- Activates a row for PC1 independently, respecting **tRRD** (ACT to ACT delay).

---

### 3. üéØ READ Commands

#### READ PC0
- Issued after tRCD from ACTIVATE.
- Pulls 256 bits (32 bytes) in 8 bursts (BL8) through DQ[31:0].

#### READ PC1
- Independent of PC0, uses DQ[63:32].
- Starts after its own tRCD delay.

**Read Latency (RL)**: Time from READ command to data output.

### 4. üì° Data Output

Each PC transfers data in bursts:

| Pseudo-Channel | DQ Bus       | Transfer | Data per Burst |
|----------------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| PC0            | DQ[31:0]     | BL8      | 256 bits       |
| PC1            | DQ[63:32]    | BL8      | 256 bits       |

---

### 5. üîÅ Multiple Activates & Reads

- **ACTIVATE to ACTIVATE (same PC)**: Allowed after tRRD if accessing different banks.
- **READ to READ (same PC)**: Can happen back-to-back if tCCD spacing is met.
- **Second READ often skips extra tRCD**: If targeting already open row (row hit).

---

### 6. üîö PRECHARGE Commands

- **PRECHARGE** closes a row after tRAS (minimum active time).
- **tRTP** is required between last READ and PRECHARGE.

You may see:
- One PRECHARGE per row
- Multiple PRECHARGEs if multiple banks in PC1 are accessed

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timing Summary

| Parameter | Meaning                              |
|----------:|--------------------------------------|
| `tRCD`    | ACTIVATE ‚Üí READ                      |
| `tRRD`    | ACTIVATE ‚Üí ACTIVATE (diff banks)     |
| `tRAS`    | Row Active time                      |
| `tRTP`    | READ ‚Üí PRECHARGE                     |
| `RL`      | READ Latency                         |
| `BL8`     | Burst Length = 8 √ó 32-bit            |

## ‚úÖ Operation Sequence

```text
T0  : ACTIVATE PC0
T1  : ACTIVATE PC1 (after tRRD)
T2  : READ PC0 (after tRCD)
T3  : Data Da‚ÄìDa+7 output on DQ[31:0] after RL
T4  : READ PC0 again (new row)
T5  : READ PC1
T6  : Data Db‚ÄìDb+7 output on DQ[63:32] after RL
T7  : PRECHARGE PC0
T8  : PRECHARGE PC1
```

## üîß Why Pseudo Channels Matter

- Allow independent access to memory banks
- Boost throughput using parallelism
- Reduce contention and interleaving delays
